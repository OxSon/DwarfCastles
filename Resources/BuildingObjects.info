Building ojbects using .dc files
Each file represents an object or a set of default values

For instance, Entity.dc represents a set of default values that all entities have

To inherit from this, you will type .entitiy at the top of a .dc file along with other inheritences
Inheritences will go in order, and the latests inheritence will be used

Each line in a file after inheritence represents a single tag
Tags are created with values, though this can also be left blank (Intended for declaring Subtags)
When creating a tag, the format of the tag is TagName:TagValue
e.g. file
weight:10
passable:no
name:chair

e.g. blank tag
cool:


Indented lines represent subtags to the tag before it with less tabs
e.g.
harvestable:yes
	tool:yes
		type:axe
	yeild:yes
		resource:
			name:wood
			amount:50

In this example, something has a tag of being harvestable, and then the harvestable tag has a tag representing the tool that needs to be used, and the yeild of the harvest
